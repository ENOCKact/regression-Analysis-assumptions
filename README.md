How to visualize regression assumptions in a single plot

We normally make assumptions When using `linear regression` to model relationship between response variable and one or more dependent variable.They are supposed to be meet before drawing any inference about regression parameters.Some of the assumptions are as follows:

* The true relationship is linear
* Errors are normally distributed
* Homoscedasticity of errors (or, equal variance around the line).
* Independence of the observations

The following plot is used to visualize all above assumption.We are going to use `mtcars` dataset for our analysis.
